## Mapping ER Model to relational model

## Steps from EER â‡’ schema

- Option of mapping specialization or generalization
    - Multiple relations for super-classes and subclasses
        
        Subclass attributes â†’ local attribute and PK superclass only
        ðŸŽ¯ all constrain is ok

    - Multiple relations for subclasses
        
        Subclass attributes â†’ local attribute and all superclass attributes
        ðŸŽ¯ Disjoint and total

    - Single relation (to sub and super) with one type attribute
        
        ðŸŽ¯Disjoint

        ![img](/img/7.7.png)
        
    - Single relation with multiple type attributes
        PK + all attribute from sub and type attribute
         type attribute it is a boolean value
        ðŸŽ¯ overlapping
